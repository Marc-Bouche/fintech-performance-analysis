# Fintech Performance Analysis
An analysis of the BigQuery Fintech Dataset, focusing on profitability, revenue growth, and cost optimization. Using SQL, Python, and Tableau, the project provides insights into financial performance and customer retention, showcasing skills in data analysis and visualization.

Objective:
To analyze the financial performance of a fintech company using key metrics such as profitability, revenue growth, and cost optimization. The goal is to answer a business question and provide actionable insights to improve financial sustainability and operational efficiency.

Business Question:
How can a fintech company optimize its financial operations to improve profitability and enhance customer retention while maintaining sustainable growth?

Proposed Workflow:
1. Data Exploration:
Import the dataset into MySQL for querying and analysis.
Explore the six interconnected tables to understand the data structure, relationships, and key variables.
Identify the relevant tables and columns for profitability, revenue, and customer metrics.
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Create a clean and normalized dataset in MySQL.
Use Python for additional data transformation or statistical tests, if required.
3. Identifying KPIs:
Profitability: Net profit margin, return on assets (ROA).
Revenue Growth: Year-over-year revenue growth, customer lifetime value (CLV).
Cost Optimization: Operating expense ratio, cost of goods sold (COGS) percentage.
4. Hypothesis Development:
Hypothesis 1: Customers with higher transaction volumes contribute to higher profitability.
Hypothesis 2: Revenue growth is positively correlated with customer retention rates.
Hypothesis 3: Reducing operational costs leads to significant improvements in net profit margin.
Hypothesis 4: Enhanced customer engagement metrics (e.g., transaction frequency) indicate improved financial health.
5. Data Analysis:
Use MySQL to query and aggregate key metrics for each KPI.
Perform hypothesis testing using Python to validate assumptions.
Conduct trend analysis to identify revenue growth patterns over time.
6. Visualization:
Use Tableau Desktop to create an interactive dashboard showcasing:
Key financial KPIs.
Customer retention and engagement metrics.
Revenue trends and profitability insights.
Include filters for geographic regions, time periods, and customer segments.
7. Business Recommendations:
Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations based on insights.
Address the business question with specific strategies for profitability and growth.
Next Steps:
Download the dataset and load it into MySQL.
Draft a schema to visualize the relationships between the six tables.
Start with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key trends and metrics.
